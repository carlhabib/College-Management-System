8. College Management System:
This project consists in developing a DB and related software applications to handle the information needs of an academic institution or college.


In any major academic institution or college, there is a DB system containing information about students, 
their major and minor fields, the courses they are enrolled in, details about the students’ financial aids, 
the classes each student has taken in previous years or is taking the current year,
and details of all student examination results.


The DB may also contain details related to the next academic year’s admissions,
as well as details concerning faculty and staff with salary related information concerning the payroll office, etc.


Additional information needs/functionalities can (should) be investigated by the student group
